Category Ajax Chain Selects

== Description ==

This plugin makes it easy to have chain select category/custom taxonomy drop downs in your theme using Ajax.

The plugin was created as a way for me to use chain selects on a number of websites I have built over the past few 
years. As it was my first attempt at making a Wordpress plugin, I thought it would be best to go back and update it to work with the latest version of WordPress and is now compatible with custom taxonomies.

Feel free to visit my website www.peterjharrison.me or contact me at

Have fun!

== Installation ==

1. Upload the full directory into your wp-content/plugins directory
2. Activate it in the Plugin options
3. Add the template tag: `<?php echo chainselect_getcategories('taxonomy name'); ?>` into you page template.
4. For more options please see the plugin page.
